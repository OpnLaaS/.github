# OpnLaaS

OpnLaaS is a project bringing the concept of "Lab as a Service" to the open source space. OpnLaaS is designed from the ground up to support as many types of hardware and virtualization environments as possible. Giving users the ability to create a hybrid lab on demand of both physical and virtual resources, OpnLaaS is both lightweight and powerful, including secure user authentication, custom configuration, dynamic monitoring for hardware, and more.
